## Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

##  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

##  Program
~~~
a = (0 == True) 
b = (False== False) 
c = True + True 
d = False + 9 
print("a is", a) 
print("b is", b) 
print("c:", c) 
print("d:", d)
~~~

## Output
![438644668-e4255b78-6971-4bf6-af13-63afded805cf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d0c31d7-2326-47e5-9920-0f0d8abb9774)

## Result
Thus the program has been successfully executed
